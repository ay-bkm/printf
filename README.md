# Custom Printf Function

This repository contains a simplified custom implementation of the `printf` function in C. The `_printf` function supports limited conversion specifiers and is designed as an educational project.

## Functionality

The `_printf` function produces formatted output similar to the standard `printf` function. It supports the following conversion specifiers:

- `%c`: Print a character.
- `%s`: Print a string.
- `%%`: Print a literal `%` character.
- `%d` or `%i`: Print a signed integer.
